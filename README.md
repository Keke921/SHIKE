This is the repository of the CVPR 2023 paper: "Long-Tailed Visual Recognition via Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation." We find that deep neural networks have different preferences towards the long-tailed distribution according to the depth. SHIKE is designed as a Mixture of Experts (MoE) method, which fuses  features of different depths and enables transfer among experts,  boosting the performance effectively in long-tailed visual recognition. 

#### Requirements
```
python  3.7.7 or above
torch   1.11.0 or above
```
### Reproducibility
Using the requirements file in this repo to create a virtual env.
Reset the seed to 0 (line 49 in cifarTrain.py) and you may get the ideal result.

### Implementation for all datasets is still under reoganizing...
stay tuned for itï½ž

### Acknowledgement
Data augmentation in SHIKE mainly follows [BalancedMetaSoftmax](https://github.com/jiawei-ren/BalancedMetaSoftmax-Classification) and [PaCo](https://github.com/dvlab-research/Parametric-Contrastive-Learning).
